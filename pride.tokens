	no very difficult point . 
	to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . 
	i can not blame myself for having done thus much . 
	there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . 
	i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . 
	that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . 
	perhaps this concealment , this disguise was beneath me ; it is done , however , and it was done for the best . 
	on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 
	if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them . 
	`` with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 
	of what he has _ particularly _ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . 
	`` mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on george wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . 
	my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge -- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . 
	my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . 
	as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . 
	the vicious propensities -- the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have . 
	here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . 
	but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character -- it adds even another motive . 
	`` my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow -- and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . 
	there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . 
	his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . 
	he had some intention , he added , of studying law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . 
	i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . 
	i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman ; the business was therefore soon settled -- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . 
	all connection between us seemed now dissolved . 
	i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town . 
	in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . 
	for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . 
	his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 
	he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . 
	you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition to it . 
	his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . 
	after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . 
	how he lived i know not . 
	but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 
	`` i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . 
	having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . 
	my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . 
	about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . 
	she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . 
	i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . 
	you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . 
	regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge . 
	mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . 
	his revenge would have been complete indeed . 
	`` this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham . 
	i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . 
	ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . 
	`` you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ; but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 
	for the truth of everything here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and , still more , as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 
	if your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 
	i will only add , god bless you . 
	`` fitzwilliam darcy '' chapter 36 if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . 
	but such as they were , it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . 
	her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . 
	with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 
	with a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . 
	she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 
	his belief of her sister 's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 
	he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . 
	it was all pride and insolence . 
	but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham -- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . 
	astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 
	she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false ! 
	this can not be ! 
	this must be the grossest falsehood ! '' 
	-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . 
	in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 
	the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 
	so far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 
	what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 
	but when she read and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 
	she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . 
	on both sides it was only assertion . 
	again she read on ; but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . 
	the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 
	she had never heard of him before his entrance into the -- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . 
	of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself . 
	as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . 
	his countenance , voice , and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 
	she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years ' continuance . 
	but no such recollection befriended her . 
	she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . 
	after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . 
	but , alas ! 
	the story which followed , of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question . 
	at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration . 
	she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. phillips 's . 
	many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . 
	she was _ now _ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 
	she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 
	she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy -- that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . 
	she remembered also that , till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . 
	how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned ! 
	his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . 
	his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . 
	every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _ some _ amiable feeling ; that had his actions been what mr. wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible . 
	she grew absolutely ashamed of herself . 
	of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . 
	`` how despicably i have acted ! '' 
	she cried ; `` i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! 
	i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! 
	who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust ! 
	how humiliating is this discovery ! 
	yet , how just a humiliation ! 
	had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind ! 
	but vanity , not love , has been my folly . 
	pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 
	till this moment i never knew myself . '' 
	from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy 's explanation _ there _ had appeared very insufficient , and she read it again . 
	widely different was the effect of a second perusal . 
	how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? 
	he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister 's attachment ; and she could not help remembering what charlotte 's opinion had always been . 
	neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane . 
	she felt that jane 's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility . 
	when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 
	the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers . 
	the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt . 
	it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that jane 's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before . 
	after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought -- re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 
	she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr. darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave -- but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . 
	elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . 
	colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object ; she could think only of her letter . 
	chapter 37 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning , and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . 
	to rosings he then hastened , to console lady catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . 
	elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship 's indignation would have been . 
	`` what would she have said ? 
	how would she have behaved ? '' 
	were questions with which she amused herself . 
	their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party . 
	`` i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , '' said lady catherine ; `` i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do . 
	but i am particularly attached to these young men , and know them to be so much attached to me ! 
	they were excessively sorry to go ! 
	but so they always are . 
	the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more , i think , than last year . 
	his attachment to rosings certainly increases . '' 
	mr. collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 
	lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it by herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added : `` but if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer . 
	mrs. collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure . '' 
	`` i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , '' replied elizabeth , `` but it is not in my power to accept it . 
	i must be in town next saturday . '' 
	`` why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . 
	i expected you to stay two months . 
	i told mrs. collins so before you came . 
	there can be no occasion for your going so soon . 
	mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . '' 
	`` but my father can not . 
	he wrote last week to hurry my return . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . 
	daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . 
	and if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche-box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . '' 
	`` you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan . '' 
	lady catherine seemed resigned . 
	`` mrs. collins , you must send a servant with them . 
	you know i always speak my mind , and i can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . 
	it is highly improper . 
	you must contrive to send somebody . 
	i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . 
	young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . 
	when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men-servants go with her . 
	miss darcy , the daughter of mr. darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . 
	i am excessively attentive to all those things . 
	you must send john with the young ladies , mrs. collins . 
	i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . '' 
	`` my uncle is to send a servant for us . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	your uncle ! 
	he keeps a man-servant , does he ? 
	i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things . 
	where shall you change horses ? 
	oh ! 
	bromley , of course . 
	if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . '' 
	lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . 
	reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . 
	mr. darcy 's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 
	she studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . 
	when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 
	his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 
	in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin . 
	they were hopeless of remedy . 
	her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . 
	elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 
	catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia 's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . 
	they were ignorant , idle , and vain . 
	while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there forever . 
	anxiety on jane 's behalf was another prevailing concern ; and mr. darcy 's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . 
	his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . 
	how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! 
	when to these recollections was added the development of wickham 's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . 
	their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first . 
	the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . 
	when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both . 
	chapter 38 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . 
	`` i know not , miss elizabeth , '' said he , `` whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . 
	the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . 
	we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . 
	our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . '' 
	elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 
	she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _ her _ feel the obliged . 
	mr. collins was gratified , and with a more smiling solemnity replied : `` it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . 
	we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and , from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . 
	our situation with regard to lady catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . 
	you see on what a footing we are . 
	you see how continually we are engaged there . 
	in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings . '' 
	words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . 
	`` you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . 
	i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . 
	lady catherine 's great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . 
	only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . 
	my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking . 
	there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . 
	we seem to have been designed for each other . '' 
	elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . 
	she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang . 
	poor charlotte ! 
	it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! 
	but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . 
	her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . 
	at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . 
	after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins , and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner , though unknown . 
	he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings . 
	`` but , '' he added , `` you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . '' 
	elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . 
	`` good gracious ! '' 
	cried maria , after a few minutes ' silence , `` it seems but a day or two since we first came ! 
	and yet how many things have happened ! '' 
	`` a great many indeed , '' said her companion with a sigh . 
	`` we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! 
	how much i shall have to tell ! '' 
	elizabeth added privately , `` and how much i shall have to conceal ! '' 
	their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner 's house , where they were to remain a few days . 
	jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 
	but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . 
	it was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. darcy 's proposals . 
	to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further . 
	chapter 39 it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of -- , in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet 's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman 's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs . 
	these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a salad and cucumber . 
	after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , `` is not this nice ? 
	is not this an agreeable surprise ? '' 
	`` and we mean to treat you all , '' added lydia , `` but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . '' 
	then , showing her purchases -- `` look here , i have bought this bonnet . 
	i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not . 
	i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . '' 
	and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , `` oh ! 
	but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable . 
	besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the -- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . '' 
	`` are they indeed ! '' 
	cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . 
	`` they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! 
	it would be such a delicious scheme ; and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all . 
	mamma would like to go too of all things ! 
	only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! '' 
	`` yes , '' thought elizabeth , '' _ that _ would be a delightful scheme indeed , and completely do for us at once . 
	good heaven ! 
	brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton ! '' 
	`` now i have got some news for you , '' said lydia , as they sat down at table . 
	`` what do you think ? 
	it is excellent news -- capital news -- and about a certain person we all like ! '' 
	jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told he need not stay . 
	lydia laughed , and said : `` aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . 
	you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 
	i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say . 
	but he is an ugly fellow ! 
	i am glad he is gone . 
	i never saw such a long chin in my life . 
	well , but now for my news ; it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is it not ? 
	there is no danger of wickham 's marrying mary king . 
	there 's for you ! 
	she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool : gone to stay . 
	wickham is safe . '' 
	`` and mary king is safe ! '' 
	added elizabeth ; `` safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . '' 
	`` she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . '' 
	`` but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , '' said jane . 
	`` i am sure there is not on _ his _ . 
	i will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her -- who could about such a nast. little freckled thing ? '' 
	elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _ expression _ herself , the coarseness of the _ sentiment _ was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal ! 
	as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , work-bags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty 's and lydia 's purchases , were seated in it . 
	`` how nicely we are all crammed in , '' cried lydia . 
	`` i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! 
	well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . 
	and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . 
	have you seen any pleasant men ? 
	have you had any flirting ? 
	i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . 
	jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . 
	she is almost three-and-twenty ! 
	lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three-and-twenty ! 
	my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands , you ca n't think . 
	she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ; but _ i _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . 
	lord ! 
	how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls . 
	dear me ! 
	we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster 's . 
	kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; -lrb- by the bye , mrs. forster and me are _ such _ friends ! -rrb- 
	and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? 
	we dressed up chamberlayne in woman 's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! 
	not a soul knew of it , but colonel and mrs. forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! 
	when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . 
	lord ! 
	how i laughed ! 
	and so did mrs. forster . 
	i thought i should have died . 
	and _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . '' 
	with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty 's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . 
	elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham 's name . 
	their reception at home was most kind . 
	mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth : `` i am glad you are come back , lizzy . '' 
	their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects that occupied them : lady lucas was inquiring of maria , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and , on the other , retailing them all to the younger lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . 
	`` oh ! 
	mary , '' said she , `` i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! 
	as we went along , kitty and i drew up the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 
	and then when we came away it was such fun ! 
	i thought we never should have got into the coach . 
	i was ready to die of laughter . 
	and then we were so merry all the way home ! 
	we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! '' 
	to this mary very gravely replied , `` far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures ! 
	they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . 
	but i confess they would have no charms for _ me _ -- i should infinitely prefer a book . '' 
	but of this answer lydia heard not a word . 
	she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . 
	in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton , and to see how everybody went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 
	it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . 
	there was another reason too for her opposition . 
	she dreaded seeing mr. wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 
	the comfort to _ her _ of the regiment 's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression . 
	in a fortnight they were to go -- and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 
	she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 
	elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . 
	chapter 40 elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length , resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself . 
	miss bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 
	she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him . 
	`` his being so sure of succeeding was wrong , '' said she , `` and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ! '' 
	`` indeed , '' replied elizabeth , `` i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 
	you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? '' 
	`` blame you ! 
	oh , no . '' 
	`` but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham ? '' 
	`` no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . '' 
	`` but you _ will _ know it , when i tell you what happened the very next day . '' 
	she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . 
	what a stroke was this for poor jane ! 
	who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual . 
	nor was darcy 's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 
	most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear the one without involving the other . 
	`` this will not do , '' said elizabeth ; `` you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . 
	take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . 
	there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . 
	for my part , i am inclined to believe it all darcy 's ; but you shall do as you choose . '' 
	it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . 
	`` i do not know when i have been more shocked , '' said she . 
	`` wickham so very bad ! 
	it is almost past belief . 
	and poor mr. darcy ! 
	dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . 
	such a disappointment ! 
	and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too ! 
	and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! 
	it is really too distressing . 
	i am sure you must feel it so . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . 
	i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . 
	your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . '' 
	`` poor wickham ! 
	there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! 
	such an openness and gentleness in his manner ! '' 
	`` there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . 
	one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . '' 
	`` i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . '' 
	`` and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . 
	it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . 
	one may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . '' 
	`` lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . '' 
	`` indeed , i could not . 
	i was uncomfortable enough , i may say unhappy . 
	and with no one to speak to about what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! 
	oh ! 
	how i wanted you ! '' 
	`` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . '' 
	`` certainly . 
	but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . 
	there is one point on which i want your advice . 
	i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand wickham 's character . '' 
	miss bennet paused a little , and then replied , `` surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 
	what is your opinion ? '' 
	`` that it ought not to be attempted . 
	mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . 
	on the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 
	the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 
	i am not equal to it . 
	wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is . 
	some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . 
	at present i will say nothing about it . '' 
	`` you are quite right . 
	to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 
	he is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character . 
	we must not make him desperate . '' 
	the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation . 
	she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . 
	but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure . 
	she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend . 
	here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . 
	`` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 
	the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! '' 
	she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister 's spirits . 
	jane was not happy . 
	she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . 
	having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and , from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . 
	`` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of jane 's ? 
	for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . 
	i told my sister phillips so the other day . 
	but i can not find out that jane saw anything of him in london . 
	well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there 's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 
	there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . '' 
	`` i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more . '' 
	`` oh well ! 
	it is just as he chooses . 
	nobody wants him to come . 
	though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it . 
	well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart ; and then he will be sorry for what he has done . '' 
	but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer . 
	`` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother , soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? 
	well , well , i only hope it will last . 
	and what sort of table do they keep ? 
	charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say . 
	if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 
	there is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , i dare say . '' 
	`` no , nothing at all . '' 
	`` a great deal of good management , depend upon it . 
	yes , yes . 
	_ they _ will take care not to outrun their income . 
	_ they _ will never be distressed for money . 
	well , much good may it do them ! 
	and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . 
	they look upon it as quite their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . '' 
	`` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . '' 
	`` no ; it would have been strange if they had ; but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . 
	well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . 
	i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . '' 
	chapter 41 the first week of their return was soon gone . 
	the second began . 
	it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . 
	the dejection was almost universal . 
	the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . 
	very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family . 
	`` good heaven ! 
	what is to become of us ? 
	what are we to do ? '' 
	would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . 
	`` how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? '' 
	their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five-and-twenty years ago . 
	`` i am sure , '' said she , `` i cried for two days together when colonel miller 's regiment went away . 
	i thought i should have broken my heart . '' 
	`` i am sure i shall break _ mine _ , '' said lydia . 
	`` if one could but go to brighton ! '' 
	observed mrs. bennet . 
	`` oh , yes ! 
	-- if one could but go to brighton ! 
	but papa is so disagreeable . '' 
	`` a little sea-bathing would set me up forever . '' 
	`` and my aunt phillips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , '' added kitty . 
	such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house . 
	elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 
	she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy 's objections ; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 
	but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . 
	this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . 
	a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _ three _ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _ two _ . 
	the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . 
	wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . 
	`` i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask _ me _ as well as lydia , '' said she , `` though i am _ not _ her particular friend . 
	i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . '' 
	in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . 
	as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . 
	she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . 
	he heard her attentively , and then said : `` lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . '' 
	`` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner -- nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . '' 
	`` already arisen ? '' 
	repeated mr. bennet . 
	`` what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? 
	poor little lizzy ! 
	but do not be cast down . 
	such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . 
	come , let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia 's folly . '' 
	`` indeed you are mistaken . 
	i have no such injuries to resent . 
	it is not of particular , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . 
	our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia 's character . 
	excuse me , for i must speak plainly . 
	if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 
	her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 
	in this danger kitty also is comprehended . 
	she will follow wherever lydia leads . 
	vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! 
	oh ! 
	my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? '' 
	mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject , and affectionately taking her hand said in reply : `` do not make yourself uneasy , my love . 
	wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three -- very silly sisters . 
	we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . 
	let her go , then . 
	colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . 
	at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . 
	the officers will find women better worth their notice . 
	let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . 
	at any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life . '' 
	with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 
	it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them . 
	she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 
	had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . 
	in lydia 's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . 
	she saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers . 
	she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . 
	she saw all the glories of the camp -- its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once . 
	had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? 
	they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . 
	lydia 's going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband 's never intending to go there himself . 
	but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of lydia 's leaving home . 
	elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time . 
	having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . 
	she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . 
	in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 
	she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . 
	on the very last day of the regiment 's remaining at meryton , he dined , with other of the officers , at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam 's and mr. darcy 's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him , if he was acquainted with the former . 
	he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment 's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . 
	her answer was warmly in his favour . 
	with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added : `` how long did you say he was at rosings ? '' 
	`` nearly three weeks . '' 
	`` and you saw him frequently ? '' 
	`` yes , almost every day . '' 
	`` his manners are very different from his cousin 's . '' 
	`` yes , very different . 
	but i think mr. darcy improves upon acquaintance . '' 
	`` indeed ! '' 
	cried mr. wickham with a look which did not escape her . 
	`` and pray , may i ask ? 
	-- '' but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , `` is it in address that he improves ? 
	has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? 
	-- for i dare not hope , '' he continued in a lower and more serious tone , `` that he is improved in essentials . '' 
	`` oh , no ! '' 
	said elizabeth . 
	`` in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . '' 
	while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . 
	there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added : `` when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . '' 
	wickham 's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent , till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents : `` you , who so well know my feeling towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . 
	his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . 
	i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe . 
	his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . '' 
	elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . 
	she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 
	the rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 
	when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 
	the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . 
	kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . 
	mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible -- advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 
	chapter 42 had elizabeth 's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . 
	her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . 
	respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . 
	but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . 
	he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . 
	to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . 
	this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . 
	elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father 's behaviour as a husband . 
	she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . 
	but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents , which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . 
	when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . 
	their parties abroad were less varied than before , and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp . 
	upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 
	it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity -- to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 
	her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . 
	`` but it is fortunate , '' thought she , `` that i have something to wish for . 
	were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . 
	but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised . 
	a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . '' 
	when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . 
	those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 
	after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn . 
	everything wore a happier aspect . 
	the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . 
	mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of june , kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton . 
	the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching , and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . 
	mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month , and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour , and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire . 
	in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . 
	the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak . 
	elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough . 
	but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again . 
	with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected . 
	it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . 
	`` but surely , '' said she , `` i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . '' 
	the period of expectation was now doubled . 
	four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt 's arrival . 
	but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . 
	the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 
	the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . 
	one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness of companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad . 
	it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenilworth , birmingham , etc. are sufficiently known . 
	a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern . 
	to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner 's former residence , and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated . 
	it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . 
	in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . 
	mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 
	`` my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? '' 
	said her aunt ; `` a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected . 
	wickham passed all his youth there , you know . '' 
	elizabeth was distressed . 
	she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . 
	she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . 
	mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity . 
	`` if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , '' said she , `` i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . 
	they have some of the finest woods in the country . '' 
	elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce . 
	the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 
	it would be dreadful ! 
	she blushed at the very idea , and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk . 
	but against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered . 
	accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place ? 
	what was the name of its proprietor ? 
	and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer ? 
	a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms now being removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 
	to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . 
	chapter 43 elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . 
	the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . 
	they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent . 
	elizabeth 's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . 
	they gradually ascended for half-a-mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . 
	it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . 
	its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned . 
	elizabeth was delighted . 
	she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward tast. . 
	they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! 
	they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned . 
	she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . 
	on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . 
	the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . 
	they followed her into the dining-parlour . 
	it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . 
	elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . 
	the hill , crowned with wood , which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . 
	every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . 
	as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . 
	the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his tast. , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . 
	`` and of this place , '' thought she , `` i might have been mistress ! 
	with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! 
	instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . 
	but no , '' -- recollecting herself -- `` that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; i should not have been allowed to invite them . '' 
	this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something very like regret . 
	she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent , but had not the courage for it . 
	at length however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied that he was , adding , `` but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends . '' 
	how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 
	her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 
	she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantelpiece . 
	her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 
	the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master 's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense . 
	`` he is now gone into the army , '' she added ; `` but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . '' 
	mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . 
	`` and that , '' said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , `` is my master -- and very like him . 
	it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . '' 
	`` i have heard much of your master 's fine person , '' said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; `` it is a handsome face . 
	but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . '' 
	mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . 
	`` does that young lady know mr. darcy ? '' 
	elizabeth coloured , and said : `` a little . '' 
	`` and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? '' 
	`` yes , very handsome . '' 
	`` i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . 
	this room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . 
	he was very fond of them . '' 
	this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham 's being among them . 
	mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 
	`` and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? '' 
	said mrs. gardiner . 
	`` oh ! 
	yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! 
	-- she plays and sings all day long . 
	in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to-morrow with him . '' 
	mr. gardiner , whose manners were very easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs. reynolds , either by pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . 
	`` is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? '' 
	`` not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . '' 
	`` except , '' thought elizabeth , `` when she goes to ramsgate . '' 
	`` if your master would marry , you might see more of him . '' 
	`` yes , sir ; but i do not know when _ that _ will be . 
	i do not know who is good enough for him . '' 
	mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled . 
	elizabeth could not help saying , `` it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . '' 
	`` i say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , '' replied the other . 
	elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , `` i have never known a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . '' 
	this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . 
	that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion . 
	her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying : `` there are very few people of whom so much can be said . 
	you are lucky in having such a master . '' 
	`` yes , sir , i know i am . 
	if i were to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . 
	but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted boy in the world . '' 
	elizabeth almost stared at her . 
	`` can this be mr. darcy ? '' 
	thought she . 
	`` his father was an excellent man , '' said mrs. gardiner . 
	`` yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . '' 
	elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . 
	mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point . 
	she related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain . 
	mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 
	`` he is the best landlord , and the best master , '' said she , `` that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves . 
	there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name . 
	some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw anything of it . 
	to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . '' 
	`` in what an amiable light does this place him ! '' 
	thought elizabeth . 
	`` this fine account of him , '' whispered her aunt as they walked , `` is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . '' 
	`` perhaps we might be deceived . '' 
	`` that is not very likely ; our authority was too good . '' 
	on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley . 
	`` he is certainly a good brother , '' said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . 
	mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy 's delight , when she should enter the room . 
	`` and this is always the way with him , '' she added . 
	`` whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment . 
	there is nothing he would not do for her . '' 
	the picture-gallery , and two or three of the principal bedrooms , were all that remained to be shown . 
	in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . 
	in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . 
	elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . 
	at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her . 
	she stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . 
	mrs. reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father 's lifetime . 
	there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance . 
	the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature . 
	what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? 
	as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship ! 
	-- how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow ! 
	-- how much of good or evil must be done by him ! 
	every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . 
	when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned downstairs , and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall-door . 
	as they walked across the hall towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . 
	they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . 
	their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush . 
	he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . 
	she had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . 
	had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 
	they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family . 
	amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life . 
	nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her having stayed in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . 
	at length every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . 
	the others then joined her , and expressed admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . 
	she was overpowered by shame and vexation . 
	her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world ! 
	how strange it must appear to him ! 
	in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! 
	it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! 
	oh ! 
	why did she come ? 
	or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? 
	had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived -- that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . 
	she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . 
	and his behaviour , so strikingly altered -- what could it mean ? 
	that he should even speak to her was amazing ! 
	-- but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family ! 
	never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . 
	what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park , when he put his letter into her hand ! 
	she knew not what to think , or how to account for it . 
	they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 
	her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was . 
	she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind -- in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . 
	perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice which was not like ease . 
	whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 
	at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 
	they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; when , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . 
	mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . 
	with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round . 
	it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts . 
	they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it . 
	elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . 
	her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the tast. , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 
	whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . 
	the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . 
	elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 
	for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . 
	the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them . 
	with a glance , she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed . 
	her colour changed , and she said no more . 
	mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 
	this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself . 
	`` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are ? 
	he takes them now for people of fashion . '' 
	the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it , and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . 
	that he was _ surprised _ by the connection was evident ; he sustained it , however , with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner . 
	elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . 
	it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 
	she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his tast. , or his good manners . 
	the conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . 
	mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm-in-arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of wonder . 
	elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 
	her astonishment , however , was extreme , and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ? 
	from what can it proceed ? 
	it can not be for _ me _ -- it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . 
	my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . 
	it is impossible that he should still love me . '' 
	after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . 
	it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's . 
	mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . 
	after a short silence , the lady first spoke . 
	she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected -- `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . '' 
	he acknowledged the truth of it all , and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . 
	`` they will join me early to-morrow , '' he continued , `` and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you -- mr. bingley and his sisters . '' 
	elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . 
	her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been the last mentioned between them ; and , if she might judge by his complexion , _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged . 
	`` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you . 
	will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? '' 
	the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . 
	she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother , and , without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . 
	they now walked on in silence , each of them deep in thought . 
	elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 
	his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind . 
	they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . 
	he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 
	at such a time much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . 
	she wanted to talk , but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject . 
	at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance . 
	yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over . 
	on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with utmost politeness . 
	mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . 
	the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected . 
	`` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle . 
	`` there _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , '' replied her aunt , `` but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . 
	i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . '' 
	`` i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 
	it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . 
	his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . '' 
	`` to be sure , lizzy , '' said her aunt , `` he is not so handsome as wickham ; or , rather , he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 
	but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ? '' 
	elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 
	`` but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , '' replied her uncle . 
	`` your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . '' 
	elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character , but said nothing . 
	`` from what we have seen of him , '' continued mrs. gardiner , `` i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham . 
	he has not an ill-natured look . 
	on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . 
	and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . 
	but , to be sure , the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character ! 
	i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . 
	but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _ that _ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . '' 
	elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . 
	in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . 
	mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else . 
	fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years ' discontinuance . 
	the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy 's civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 
	chapter 44 elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 
	but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton , these visitors came . 
	they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street . 
	elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . 
	her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 
	nothing had ever suggested it before , but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece . 
	while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth 's feelings was at every moment increasing . 
	she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 
	she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse . 
	miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . 
	with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 
	since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . 
	she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . 
	miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . 
	she was less handsome than her brother ; but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 
	elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings . 
	they had not long been together before mr. darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley 's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
	all elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . 
	he inquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done . 
	to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . 
	they had long wished to see him . 
	the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . 
	the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry ; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . 
	of the lady 's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . 
	elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 
	she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors ; she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . 
	bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . 
	in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and , oh ! 
	how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 
	sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 
	but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival to jane . 
	no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . 
	nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . 
	on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . 
	he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it `` was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; '' and , before she could reply , he added , `` it is above eight months . 
	we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . '' 
	elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _ all _ her sisters were at longbourn . 
	there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . 
	it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . 
	when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace -- when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage -- the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . 
	never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . 
	their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour ; and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . 
	miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . 
	mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _ she _ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . 
	presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . 
	bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . 
	elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . 
	eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . 
	but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 
	it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . 
	they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry . 
	of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . 
	they could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy . 
	there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 
	neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight . 
	they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit . 
	it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . 
	with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well-known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged . 
	as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out . 
	she certainly did not hate him . 
	no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . 
	the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . 
	but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked . 
	it was gratitude ; gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 
	he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 
	such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . 
	she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses . 
	it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . 
	they were , therefore , to go . 
	elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . 
	mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 
	the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon . 
	chapter 45 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side the acquaintance would now be renewed . 
	on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . 
	its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . 
	in this house they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . 
	georgiana 's reception of them was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . 
	mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 
	by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and , on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . 
	it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . 
	miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard . 
	elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . 
	this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much . 
	her own thoughts were employing her . 
	she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . 
	she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . 
	after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley 's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . 
	she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . 
	the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 
	there was now employment for the whole party -- for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches soon collected them round the table . 
	while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . 
	he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . 
	no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . 
	in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over . 
	miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk , and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . 
	miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility : `` pray , miss eliza , are not the -- shire militia removed from meryton ? 
	they must be a great loss to _ your _ family . '' 
	in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone . 
	while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy , with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 
	had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 
	not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement . 
	to no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 
	he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . 
	elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 
	her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully . 
	their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress . 
	but georgiana would not join her . 
	her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour ; his judgement could not err . 
	and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 
	when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 
	`` how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . 
	she is grown so brown and coarse ! 
	louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . '' 
	however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 
	`` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . 
	her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . 
	her nose wants character -- there is nothing marked in its lines . 
	her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i could never see anything extraordinary in them . 
	they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . '' 
	persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . 
	he was resolutely silent , however , and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued : `` i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _ she _ a beauty ! 
	-- i should as soon call her mother a wit . ' 
	but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . '' 
	`` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but _ that _ was only when i first saw her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . '' 
	he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 
	mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . 
	the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . 
	they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit -- of everything but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject . 
	chapter 46 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere . 
	elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 
	they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 
	the one missent must first be attended to ; it had been written five days ago . 
	the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . 
	it was to this effect : `` since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . 
	what i have to say relates to poor lydia . 
	an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham ! 
	imagine our surprise . 
	to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . 
	i am very , very sorry . 
	so imprudent a match on both sides ! 
	but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 
	thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step -lrb- and let us rejoice over it -rrb- marks nothing bad at heart . 
	his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . 
	our poor mother is sadly grieved . 
	my father bears it better . 
	how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . 
	they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . 
	the express was sent off directly . 
	my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . 
	colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . 
	lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . 
	i must conclude , for i can not be long from my poor mother . 
	i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written . '' 
	without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . 
	`` by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i can not answer for being coherent . 
	dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . 
	imprudent as the marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . 
	colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . 
	though lydia 's short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from b. intending to trace their route . 
	he did trace them easily to clapham , but no further ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . 
	all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road . 
	i know not what to think . 
	after making every possible inquiry on that side london , colonel f. came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success -- no such people had been seen to pass through . 
	with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . 
	i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. , but no one can throw any blame on them . 
	our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great . 
	my father and mother believe the worst , but i can not think so ill of him . 
	many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to everything ? 
	impossible ! 
	i grieve to find , however , that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted . 
	my poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . 
	could she exert herself , it would be better ; but this is not to be expected . 
	and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . 
	poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . 
	i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? 
	i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 
	adieu ! 
	i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not ; but circumstances are such that i can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . 
	i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former . 
	my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . 
	what he means to do i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening . 
	in such an exigence , my uncle 's advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	where , where is my uncle ? '' 
	cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant , and mr. darcy appeared . 
	her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia 's situation , hastily exclaimed , `` i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . 
	i must find mr. gardiner this moment , on business that can not be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . '' 
	`` good god ! 
	what is the matter ? '' 
	cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , `` i will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant go after mr. and mrs. gardiner . 
	you are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . '' 
	elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . 
	calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly . 
	on his quitting the room she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , `` let me call your maid . 
	is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? 
	a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ? 
	you are very ill . '' 
	`` no , i thank you , '' she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 
	`` there is nothing the matter with me . 
	i am quite well ; i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn . '' 
	she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . 
	darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 
	at length she spoke again . 
	`` i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news . 
	it can not be concealed from anyone . 
	my younger sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of mr. wickham . 
	they are gone off together from brighton . 
	_ you _ know him too well to doubt the rest . 
	she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . '' 
	darcy was fixed in astonishment . 
	`` when i consider , '' she added in a yet more agitated voice , `` that i might have prevented it ! 
	i , who knew what he was . 
	had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! 
	had his character been known , this could not have happened . 
	but it is all -- all too late now . '' 
	`` i am grieved indeed , '' cried darcy ; `` grieved -- shocked . 
	but is it certain -- absolutely certain ? '' 
	`` oh , yes ! 
	they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland . '' 
	`` and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? '' 
	`` my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance ; and we shall be off , i hope , in half-an-hour . 
	but nothing can be done -- i know very well that nothing can be done . 
	how is such a man to be worked on ? 
	how are they even to be discovered ? 
	i have not the smallest hope . 
	it is every way horrible ! '' 
	darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence . 
	`` when _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character -- oh ! 
	had i known what i ought , what i dared to do ! 
	but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much . 
	wretched , wretched mistake ! '' 
	darcy made no answer . 
	he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation , his brow contracted , his air gloomy . 
	elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . 
	her power was sinking ; everything _ must _ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . 
	she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . 
	it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 
	but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . 
	lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , `` i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . 
	would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress ! 
	but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 
	this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day . '' 
	`` oh , yes . 
	be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy . 
	say that urgent business calls us home immediately . 
	conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible , i know it can not be long . '' 
	he readily assured her of his secrecy ; again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting look , went away . 
	as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . 
	if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . 
	but if otherwise -- if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . 
	be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . 
	never , since reading jane 's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham 's meaning to marry her . 
	no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . 
	surprise was the least of her feelings on this development . 
	while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . 
	but now it was all too natural . 
	for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 
	she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . 
	sometimes one officer , sometimes another , had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . 
	her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object . 
	the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl -- oh ! 
	how acutely did she now feel it ! 
	she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged , a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room her impatience was severe . 
	mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing by the servant 's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy . 
	-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted . 
	not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner promised every assistance in his power . 
	elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , everything relating to their journey was speedily settled . 
	they were to be off as soon as possible . 
	`` but what is to be done about pemberley ? '' 
	cried mrs. gardiner . 
	`` john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? '' 
	`` yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 
	_ that _ is all settled . '' 
	`` what is all settled ? '' 
	repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . 
	`` and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? 
	oh , that i knew how it was ! '' 
	but wishes were vain , or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . 
	had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . 
	an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . 
	chapter 47 `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter . 
	it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best . 
	could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? 
	could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? 
	his temptation is not adequate to the risk ! '' 
	`` do you really think so ? '' 
	cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . 
	`` upon my word , '' said mrs. gardiner , `` i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion . 
	it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of . 
	i can not think so very ill of wickham . 
	can you yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? '' 
	`` not , perhaps , of neglecting his own interest ; but of every other neglect i can believe him capable . 
	if , indeed , it should be so ! 
	but i dare not hope it . 
	why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case ? '' 
	`` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! 
	and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . '' 
	`` well , then -- supposing them to be in london . 
	they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purpose . 
	it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london than in scotland . '' 
	`` but why all this secrecy ? 
	why any fear of detection ? 
	why must their marriage be private ? 
	oh , no , no -- this is not likely . 
	his most particular friend , you see by jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . 
	wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 
	he can not afford it . 
	and what claims has lydia -- what attraction has she beyond youth , health , and good humour that could make him , for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? 
	as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 
	but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . 
	lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . '' 
	`` but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage ? '' 
	`` it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , '' replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , `` that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . 
	but , really , i know not what to say . 
	perhaps i am not doing her justice . 
	but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half-year , nay , for a twelvemonth -- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 
	she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 
	since the -- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . 
	she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ? 
	susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 
	and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . '' 
	`` but you see that jane , '' said her aunt , `` does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt . '' 
	`` of whom does jane ever think ill ? 
	and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 
	but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . 
	we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . '' 
	`` and do you really know all this ? '' 
	cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . 
	`` i do indeed , '' replied elizabeth , colouring . 
	`` i told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 
	and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . 
	from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 
	yet he knew to the contrary himself . 
	he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . '' 
	`` but does lydia know nothing of this ? 
	can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? '' 
	`` oh , yes ! 
	-- that , that is the worst of all . 
	till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . 
	and when i returned home , the -- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . 
	as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ? 
	and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . 
	that _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . 
	that such a consequence as _ this _ could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts . '' 
	`` when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? '' 
	`` not the slightest . 
	i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . 
	when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 
	every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . '' 
	* * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . 
	from elizabeth 's thoughts it was never absent . 
	fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self-reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . 
	they travelled as expeditiously as possible , and , sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day . 
	it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . 
	the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ; and , when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . 
	elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them a hast. kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her . 
	elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives . 
	`` not yet , '' replied jane . 
	`` but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well . '' 
	`` is my father in town ? '' 
	`` yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word . '' 
	`` and have you heard from him often ? '' 
	`` we have heard only twice . 
	he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do . 
	he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention . '' 
	`` and my mother -- how is she ? 
	how are you all ? '' 
	`` my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 
	she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 
	she does not yet leave her dressing-room . 
	mary and kitty , thank heaven , are quite well . '' 
	`` but you -- how are you ? '' 
	cried elizabeth . 
	`` you look pale . 
	how much you must have gone through ! '' 
	her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party . 
	jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 
	when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give . 
	the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce their marriage . 
	mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ' conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing . 
	`` if i had been able , '' said she , `` to carry my point in going to brighton , with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her . 
	why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? 
	i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after . 
	i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was overruled , as i always am . 
	poor dear child ! 
	and now here 's mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 
	the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . '' 
	they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia . 
	`` do not give way to useless alarm , '' added he ; `` though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 
	it is not quite a week since they left brighton . 
	in a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . 
	as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	my dear brother , '' replied mrs. bennet , `` that is exactly what i could most wish for . 
	and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . 
	and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . 
	and , above all , keep mr. bennet from fighting . 
	tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frighted out of my wits -- and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me -- such spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day . 
	and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 
	oh , brother , how kind you are ! 
	i know you will contrive it all . '' 
	but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fear ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table , they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . 
	though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . 
	in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . 
	one came from her books , and the other from her toilette . 
	the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty . 
	as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table : `` this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . 
	but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . '' 
	then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , `` unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . '' 
	elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 
	mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . 
	in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy . 
	after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject , by saying , `` but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard . 
	give me further particulars . 
	what did colonel forster say ? 
	had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? 
	they must have seen them together for ever . '' 
	`` colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . 
	i am so grieved for him ! 
	his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . 
	he _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . '' 
	`` and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? 
	did he know of their intending to go off ? 
	had colonel forster seen denny himself ? '' 
	`` yes ; but , when questioned by _ him _ , denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it . 
	he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from _ that _ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . '' 
	`` and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? '' 
	`` how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? 
	i felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . 
	my father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . 
	kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step . 
	she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . '' 
	`` but not before they went to brighton ? '' 
	`` no , i believe not . '' 
	`` and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself ? 
	does he know his real character ? '' 
	`` i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did . 
	he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . 
	and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . '' 
	`` oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! '' 
	`` perhaps it would have been better , '' replied her sister . 
	`` but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . 
	we acted with the best intentions . '' 
	`` could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia 's note to his wife ? '' 
	`` he brought it with him for us to see . '' 
	jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth . 
	these were the contents : `` my dear harriet , `` you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i can not help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed . 
	i am going to gretna green , and if you can not guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel . 
	i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . 
	you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them and sign my name ` lydia wickham . ' 
	what a good joke it will be ! 
	i can hardly write for laughing . 
	pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night . 
	tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . 
	i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . 
	good-bye . 
	give my love to colonel forster . 
	i hope you will drink to our good journey . 
	`` your affectionate friend , `` lydia bennet . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! '' 
	cried elizabeth when she had finished it . 
	`` what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! 
	but at least it shows that _ she _ was serious on the subject of their journey . 
	whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . 
	my poor father ! 
	how he must have felt it ! '' 
	`` i never saw anyone so shocked . 
	he could not speak a word for full ten minutes . 
	my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! '' 
	`` oh ! 
	jane , '' cried elizabeth , `` was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? '' 
	`` i do not know . 
	i hope there was . 
	but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . 
	my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! 
	but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . '' 
	`` your attendance upon her has been too much for you . 
	you do not look well . 
	oh that i had been with you ! 
	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . '' 
	`` mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure ; but i did not think it right for either of them . 
	kitty is slight and delicate ; and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . 
	my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me . 
	she was of great use and comfort to us all . 
	and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . '' 
	`` she had better have stayed at home , '' cried elizabeth ; `` perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . 
	assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable . 
	let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . '' 
	she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 
	`` he meant i believe , '' replied jane , `` to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them . 
	his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham . 
	it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham . 
	if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . 
	i do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . '' 
	chapter 48 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . 
	his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . 
	they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain . 
	mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 
	when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband 's not being killed in a duel . 
	mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . 
	she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom . 
	their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up -- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham 's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them . 
	all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . 
	he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman 's family . 
	everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . 
	elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister 's ruin more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . 
	mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday his wife received a letter from him ; it told them that , on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street ; that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings . 
	mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 
	he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon . 
	there was also a postscript to this effect : `` i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself . 
	if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . 
	at present we have nothing to guide us . 
	colonel forster will , i dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . 
	but , on second thoughts , perhaps , lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . '' 
	elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved . 
	she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 
	it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the -- shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 
	every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . 
	the arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning 's impatience . 
	through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . 
	but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . 
	it was as follows : `` my dear sir , `` i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . 
	be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 
	no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune -- or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind . 
	the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . 
	and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . 
	howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . 
	they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? 
	and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 
	let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense . 
	`` i am , dear sir , etc. , etc. '' mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . 
	it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 
	his former acquaintances had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them . 
	there was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him . 
	and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . 
	colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton . 
	he owed a good deal in town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 
	mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family . 
	jane heard them with horror . 
	`` a gamester ! '' 
	she cried . 
	`` this is wholly unexpected . 
	i had not an idea of it . '' 
	mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday . 
	rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law 's entreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . 
	when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 
	`` what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ? '' 
	she cried . 
	`` sure he will not leave london before he has found them . 
	who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? '' 
	as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and the children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it . 
	the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn . 
	mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world . 
	his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 
	elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley . 
	the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that _ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia 's infamy somewhat better . 
	it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two . 
	when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . 
	he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it . 
	it was not till the afternoon , when he had joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , `` say nothing of that . 
	who should suffer but myself ? 
	it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . '' 
	`` you must not be too severe upon yourself , '' replied elizabeth . 
	`` you may well warn me against such an evil . 
	human nature is so prone to fall into it ! 
	no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame . 
	i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 
	it will pass away soon enough . '' 
	`` do you suppose them to be in london ? '' 
	`` yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? '' 
	`` and lydia used to want to go to london , '' added kitty . 
	`` she is happy then , '' said her father drily ; `` and her residence there will probably be of some duration . '' 
	then after a short silence he continued : `` lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . '' 
	they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother 's tea . 
	`` this is a parade , '' he cried , `` which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! 
	another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ; or , perhaps , i may defer it till kitty runs away . '' 
	`` i am not going to run away , papa , '' said kitty fretfully . 
	`` if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . '' '' 
	_ you _ go to brighton . 
	i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds ! 
	no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . 
	no officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village . 
	balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . 
	and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . '' 
	kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . 
	`` well , well , '' said he , `` do not make yourself unhappy . 
	if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . '' 
	chapter 49 two days after mr. bennet 's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , `` i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . '' 
	`` what do you mean , hill ? 
	we have heard nothing from town . '' 
	`` dear madam , '' cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , `` do n't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ? 
	he has been here this half-hour , and master has had a letter . '' 
	away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 
	they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said : `` if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . '' 
	upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . 
	jane , who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out : `` oh , papa , what news -- what news ? 
	have you heard from my uncle ? '' 
	`` yes i have had a letter from him by express . '' 
	`` well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? '' 
	`` what is there of good to be expected ? '' 
	said he , taking the letter from his pocket . 
	`` but perhaps you would like to read it . '' 
	elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . 
	jane now came up . 
	`` read it aloud , '' said their father , `` for i hardly know myself what it is about . '' 
	`` gracechurch street , monday , august 2 . 
	`` my dear brother , `` at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope it will give you satisfaction . 
	soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were . 
	the particulars i reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered . 
	i have seen them both -- '' `` then it is as i always hoped , '' cried jane ; `` they are married ! '' 
	elizabeth read on : `` i have seen them both . 
	they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are . 
	all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . 
	these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you . 
	i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . 
	you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . 
	the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 
	if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . 
	there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . 
	send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . 
	we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve . 
	she comes to us to-day . 
	i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . 
	yours , etc. , `` edw . 
	gardiner . '' 
	`` is it possible ? '' 
	cried elizabeth , when she had finished . 
	`` can it be possible that he will marry her ? '' 
	`` wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , '' said her sister . 
	`` my dear father , i congratulate you . '' 
	`` and have you answered the letter ? '' 
	cried elizabeth . 
	`` no ; but it must be done soon . '' 
	most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote . 
	`` oh ! 
	my dear father , '' she cried , `` come back and write immediately . 
	consider how important every moment is in such a case . '' 
	`` let me write for you , '' said jane , `` if you dislike the trouble yourself . '' 
	`` i dislike it very much , '' he replied ; `` but it must be done . '' 
	and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 
	`` and may i ask -- '' said elizabeth ; `` but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . '' 
	`` complied with ! 
	i am only ashamed of his asking so little . '' 
	`` and they _ must _ marry ! 
	yet he is _ such _ a man ! '' 
	`` yes , yes , they must marry . 
	there is nothing else to be done . 
	but there are two things that i want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am i ever to pay him . '' 
	`` money ! 
	my uncle ! '' 
	cried jane , `` what do you mean , sir ? '' 
	`` i mean , that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . '' 
	`` that is very true , '' said elizabeth ; `` though it had not occurred to me before . 
	his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! 
	oh ! 
	it must be my uncle 's doings ! 
	generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself . 
	a small sum could not do all this . '' 
	`` no , '' said her father ; `` wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . 
	i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . '' 
	`` ten thousand pounds ! 
	heaven forbid ! 
	how is half such a sum to be repaid ? '' 
	mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . 
	their father then went on to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room . 
	`` and they are really to be married ! '' 
	cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . 
	`` how strange this is ! 
	and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . 
	that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice . 
	oh , lydia ! '' 
	`` i comfort myself with thinking , '' replied jane , `` that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her . 
	though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . 
	he has children of his own , and may have more . 
	how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? '' 
	`` if he were ever able to learn what wickham 's debts have been , '' said elizabeth , `` and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own . 
	the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . 
	their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . 
	by this time she is actually with them ! 
	if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! 
	what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! '' 
	`` we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , '' said jane : `` i hope and trust they will yet be happy . 
	his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 
	their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . '' 
	`` their conduct has been such , '' replied elizabeth , `` as neither you , nor i , nor anybody can ever forget . 
	it is useless to talk of it . '' 
	it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . 
	they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . 
	he was writing and , without raising his head , coolly replied : `` just as you please . '' 
	`` may we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? '' 
	`` take whatever you like , and get away . '' 
	elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table , and they went up stairs together . 
	mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . 
	after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . 
	mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself . 
	as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner 's hope of lydia 's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . 
	she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . 
	to know that her daughter would be married was enough . 
	she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 
	`` my dear , dear lydia ! '' 
	she cried . 
	`` this is delightful indeed ! 
	she will be married ! 
	i shall see her again ! 
	she will be married at sixteen ! 
	my good , kind brother ! 
	i knew how it would be . 
	i knew he would manage everything ! 
	how i long to see her ! 
	and to see dear wickham too ! 
	but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! 
	i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly . 
	lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 
	stay , stay , i will go myself . 
	ring the bell , kitty , for hill . 
	i will put on my things in a moment . 
	my dear , dear lydia ! 
	how merry we shall be together when we meet ! '' 
	her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under . 
	`` for we must attribute this happy conclusion , '' she added , `` in a great measure to his kindness . 
	we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money . '' 
	`` well , '' cried her mother , `` it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? 
	if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents . 
	well ! 
	i am so happy ! 
	in a short time i shall have a daughter married . 
	mrs. wickham ! 
	how well it sounds ! 
	and she was only sixteen last june . 
	my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i ca n't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me . 
	we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . '' 
	she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . 
	one day 's delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual . 
	other schemes , too , came into her head . 
	`` i will go to meryton , '' said she , `` as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips . 
	and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long . 
	kitty , run down and order the carriage . 
	an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure . 
	girls , can i do anything for you in meryton ? 
	oh ! 
	here comes hill ! 
	my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? 
	miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . '' 
	mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy . 
	elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 
	poor lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 
	she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained . 
	chapter 50 mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . 
	he now wished it more than ever . 
	had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 
	the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place . 
	he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 
	when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless , for , of course , they were to have a son . 
	the son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . 
	five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia 's birth , had been certain that he would . 
	this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . 
	mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income . 
	five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children . 
	but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . 
	this was one point , with regard to lydia , at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . 
	in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . 
	he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement . 
	he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother 's hands , lydia 's expenses had been very little within that sum . 
	that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 
	when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 
	his letter was soon dispatched ; for , though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . 
	he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother , but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her . 
	the good news spread quickly through the house , and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . 
	it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . 
	to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farmhouse . 
	but there was much to be talked of in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband her misery was considered certain . 
	it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . 
	no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . 
	the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . 
	she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . 
	`` haye park might do , '' said she , `` if the gouldings could quit it -- or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! 
	i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for pulvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . '' 
	her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . 
	but when they had withdrawn , he said to her : `` mrs. bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . 
	into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . 
	i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . '' 
	a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm . 
	it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . 
	he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion . 
	mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it . 
	that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all she could believe possible . 
	she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place . 
	elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 
	she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means . 
	there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of a sister 's frailty would have mortified her so much -- not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself , for , at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them . 
	had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where , to every other objection , would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned . 
	from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink . 
	the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . 
	she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . 
	she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 
	she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 
	she was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet . 
	what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been most gladly and gratefully received ! 
	he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex ; but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 
	she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 
	his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . 
	it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 
	but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . 
	an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . 
	how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine . 
	but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 
	* * * * * mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 
	to mr. bennet 's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 
	the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . 
	`` it was greatly my wish that he should do so , '' he added , `` as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 
	and i think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's . 
	it is mr. wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 
	he has the promise of an ensigncy in general -- 's regiment , now quartered in the north . 
	it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . 
	he promises fairly ; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 
	i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself . 
	and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information ? 
	he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . 
	haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . 
	they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . 
	she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . 
	-- yours , etc. , `` e. gardiner . '' 
	mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham 's removal from the -- shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do . 
	but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it . 
	lydia 's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites . 
	`` she is so fond of mrs. forster , '' said she , `` it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 
	and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . 
	the officers may not be so pleasant in general -- 's regiment . '' 
	his daughter 's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . 
	but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 
	and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north . 
	when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . 
	elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 
	chapter 51 their sister 's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 
	the carriage was sent to meet them at -- , and they were to return in it by dinner-time . 
	their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets , and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . 
	they came . 
	the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them . 
	smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . 
	lydia 's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . 
	her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand , with an affectionate smile , to wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . 
	their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . 
	his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . 
	the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 
	elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . 
	lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . 
	she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 
	wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 
	elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . 
	she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour . 
	there was no want of discourse . 
	the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . 
	they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . 
	nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 
	`` only think of its being three months , '' she cried , `` since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 
	good gracious ! 
	when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! 
	though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . '' 
	her father lifted up his eyes . 
	jane was distressed . 
	elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , `` oh ! 
	mamma , do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day ? 
	i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side-glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like anything . '' 
	elizabeth could bear it no longer . 
	she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour . 
	she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , `` ah ! 
	jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . '' 
	it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . 
	her ease and good spirits increased . 
	she longed to see mrs. phillips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called `` mrs. wickham '' by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to show her ring , and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids . 
	`` well , mamma , '' said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , `` and what do you think of my husband ? 
	is not he a charming man ? 
	i am sure my sisters must all envy me . 
	i only hope they may have half my good luck . 
	they must all go to brighton . 
	that is the place to get husbands . 
	what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . '' 
	`` very true ; and if i had my will , we should . 
	but my dear lydia , i do n't at all like your going such a way off . 
	must it be so ? '' 
	`` oh , lord ! 
	yes ; -- there is nothing in that . 
	i shall like it of all things . 
	you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . 
	we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . '' 
	`` i should like it beyond anything ! '' 
	said her mother . 
	`` and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . '' 
	`` i thank you for my share of the favour , '' said elizabeth ; `` but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . '' 
	their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . 
	mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 
	no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . 
	these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not . 
	wickham 's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him . 
	she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . 
	lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 
	he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . 
	he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country . 
	one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth : `` lizzy , i never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , i believe . 
	you were not by , when i told mamma and the others all about it . 
	are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? '' 
	`` no really , '' replied elizabeth ; `` i think there can not be too little said on the subject . '' 
	`` la ! 
	you are so strange ! 
	but i must tell you how it went off . 
	we were married , you know , at st. clement 's , because wickham 's lodgings were in that parish . 
	and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock . 
	my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . 
	well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! 
	i was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . 
	and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . 
	however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . 
	i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . '' 
	`` well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . 
	if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . 
	not one party , or scheme , or anything . 
	to be sure london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open . 
	well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone . 
	and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . 
	well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . 
	but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out . 
	however , i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . '' 
	`` mr. darcy ! '' 
	repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . 
	`` oh , yes ! 
	-- he was to come there with wickham , you know . 
	but gracious me ! 
	i quite forgot ! 
	i ought not to have said a word about it . 
	i promised them so faithfully ! 
	what will wickham say ? 
	it was to be such a secret ! '' 
	`` if it was to be secret , '' said jane , `` say not another word on the subject . 
	you may depend upon my seeking no further . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	certainly , '' said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; `` we will ask you no questions . '' 
	`` thank you , '' said lydia , `` for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . '' 
	on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 
	but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 
	mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding . 
	it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . 
	conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 
	those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . 
	she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 
	`` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and -lrb- comparatively speaking -rrb- a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . 
	pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . '' 
	`` not that i _ shall _ , though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . '' 
	jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 
	chapter 52 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could . 
	she was no sooner in possession of it than , hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 
	`` gracechurch street , sept. 6 . 
	`` my dear niece , `` i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . 
	i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _ you _ . 
	do n't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . 
	if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 
	your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . 
	but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . 
	`` on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 
	mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . 
	it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . 
	he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; wickham repeatedly , lydia once . 
	from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . 
	the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . 
	he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . 
	his character was to speak for itself . 
	he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . 
	if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . 
	he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 
	`` there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 
	she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . 
	this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town . 
	but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 
	she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 
	wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . 
	at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction . 
	they were in -- street . 
	he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . 
	his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . 
	but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 
	she cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham . 
	she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 
	since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . 
	he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia 's flight on her own folly alone . 
	he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . 
	he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . 
	`` mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . 
	though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 
	but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country . 
	under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 
	`` they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . 
	wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . 
	`` every thing being settled between _ them _ , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home . 
	but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 
	he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . 
	he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . 
	`` on saturday he came again . 
	your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 
	`` they met again on sunday , and then _ i _ saw him too . 
	it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . 
	but our visitor was very obstinate . 
	i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . 
	he has been accused of many faults at different times , but _ this _ is the true one . 
	nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure -lrb- and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it -rrb- , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 
	`` they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . 
	but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . 
	but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . 
	`` you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . 
	his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . 
	the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . 
	it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . 
	perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody 's _ reserve , can be answerable for the event . 
	but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . 
	`` when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 
	`` i believe i have now told you every thing . 
	it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 
	lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . 
	_ he _ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain . 
	i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 
	if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen . 
	i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 
	`` mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 
	he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . 
	will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying -lrb- what i was never bold enough to say before -rrb- how much i like him . 
	his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . 
	his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . 
	i thought him very sly ; -- he hardly ever mentioned your name . 
	but slyness seems the fashion . 
	`` pray forgive me if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . 
	a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . 
	`` but i must write no more . 
	the children have been wanting me this half hour . 
	`` yours , very sincerely , `` m. gardiner . '' 
	the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 
	the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 
	he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . 
	he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . 
	her heart did whisper that he had done it for her . 
	but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her -- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . 
	brother-in-law of wickham ! 
	every kind of pride must revolt from the connection . 
	he had , to be sure , done much . 
	she was ashamed to think how much . 
	but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . 
	it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 
	it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . 
	they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing , to him . 
	oh ! 
	how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . 
	for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . 
	proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself . 
	she read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again . 
	it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 
	she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself . 
	she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one 's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham . 
	`` i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? '' 
	said he , as he joined her . 
	`` you certainly do , '' she replied with a smile ; `` but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . '' 
	`` i should be sorry indeed , if it were . 
	we were always good friends ; and now we are better . '' 
	`` true . 
	are the others coming out ? '' 
	`` i do not know . 
	mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton . 
	and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . '' 
	she replied in the affirmative . 
	`` i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . 
	and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? 
	poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me . 
	but of course she did not mention my name to you . '' 
	`` yes , she did . '' 
	`` and what did she say ? '' 
	`` that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . 
	at such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . '' 
	`` certainly , '' he replied , biting his lips . 
	elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said : `` i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . 
	we passed each other several times . 
	i wonder what he can be doing there . '' 
	`` perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , '' said elizabeth . 
	`` it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . '' 
	`` undoubtedly . 
	did you see him while you were at lambton ? 
	i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . '' 
	`` yes ; he introduced us to his sister . '' 
	`` and do you like her ? '' 
	`` very much . '' 
	`` i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 
	when i last saw her , she was not very promising . 
	i am very glad you liked her . 
	i hope she will turn out well . '' 
	`` i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . '' 
	`` did you go by the village of kympton ? '' 
	`` i do not recollect that we did . '' 
	`` i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had . 
	a most delightful place ! 
	-- excellent parsonage house ! 
	it would have suited me in every respect . '' 
	`` how should you have liked making sermons ? '' 
	`` exceedingly well . 
	i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 
	one ought not to repine ; -- but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! 
	the quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! 
	but it was not to be . 
	did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? '' 
	`` i have heard from authority , which i thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . '' 
	`` you have . 
	yes , there was something in _ that _ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . '' 
	`` i _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . '' 
	`` you did ! 
	and it was not wholly without foundation . 
	you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . '' 
	they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sister 's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile : `` come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . 
	do not let us quarrel about the past . 
	in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . '' 
	she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . 
	chapter 53 mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 
	the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . 
	`` oh ! 
	my dear lydia , '' she cried , `` when shall we meet again ? '' 
	`` oh , lord ! 
	i do n't know . 
	not these two or three years , perhaps . '' 
	`` write to me very often , my dear . '' 
	`` as often as i can . 
	but you know married women have never much time for writing . 
	my sisters may write to _ me _ . 
	they will have nothing else to do . '' 
	mr. wickham 's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 's . 
	he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . 
	`` he is as fine a fellow , '' said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , `` as ever i saw . 
	he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . 
	i am prodigiously proud of him . 
	i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law . '' 
	the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days . 
	`` i often think , '' said she , `` that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends . 
	one seems so forlorn without them . '' 
	`` this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , '' said elizabeth . 
	`` it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . '' 
	`` it is no such thing . 
	lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . 
	if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . '' 
	but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . 
	the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . 
	mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets . 
	she looked at jane , and smiled and shook her head by turns . 
	`` well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister , '' -lrb- for mrs. phillips first brought her the news -rrb- . 
	`` well , so much the better . 
	not that i care about it , though . 
	he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _ i _ never want to see him again . 
	but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it . 
	and who knows what _ may _ happen ? 
	but that is nothing to us . 
	you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . 
	and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? '' 
	`` you may depend on it , '' replied the other , `` for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . 
	he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday . 
	she was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . '' 
	miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour . 
	it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said : `` i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed . 
	but do n't imagine it was from any silly cause . 
	i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _ should _ be looked at . 
	i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . 
	i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 
	not that i am afraid of _ myself _ , but i dread other people 's remarks . '' 
	elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 
	had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it . 
	`` yet it is hard , '' she sometimes thought , `` that this poor man can not come to a house which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! 
	i _ will _ leave him to himself . '' 
	in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . 
	they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . 
	the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . 
	`` as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear , '' said mrs. bennet , `` you will wait on him of course . '' 
	`` no , no . 
	you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 
	but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . '' 
	his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield . '' 
	't is an etiquette i despise , '' said he . 
	`` if he wants our society , let him seek it . 
	he knows where we live . 
	i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . '' 
	`` well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . 
	but , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . 
	we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon . 
	that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . '' 
	consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did . 
	as the day of his arrival drew near , -- `` i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , '' said jane to her sister . 
	`` it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 
	my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much i suffer from what she says . 
	happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! '' 
	`` i wish i could say anything to comfort you , '' replied elizabeth ; `` but it is wholly out of my power . 
	you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . '' 
	mr. bingley arrived . 
	mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could . 
	she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before . 
	but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house . 
	her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . 
	jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked , -- she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . 
	`` there is a gentleman with him , mamma , '' said kitty ; `` who can it be ? '' 
	`` some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know . '' 
	`` la ! '' 
	replied kitty , `` it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . 
	mr. what 's - his-name . 
	that tall , proud man . '' 
	`` good gracious ! 
	mr. darcy ! 
	-- and so it does , i vow . 
	well , any friend of mr. bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . '' 
	jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . 
	she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . 
	both sisters were uncomfortable enough . 
	each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley 's friend , without being heard by either of them . 
	but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 
	to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley . 
	her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire . 
	the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken . 
	but she would not be secure . 
	`` let me first see how he behaves , '' said she ; `` it will then be early enough for expectation . '' 
	she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door . 
	jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . 
	on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance . 
	elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . 
	she had ventured only one glance at darcy . 
	he looked serious , as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley . 
	but , perhaps he could not in her mother 's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . 
	it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . 
	bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 
	he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend . 
	elizabeth , particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . 
	darcy , after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything . 
	he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire . 
	there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself . 
	but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 
	more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed . 
	she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . 
	`` could i expect it to be otherwise ! '' 
	said she . 
	`` yet why did he come ? '' 
	she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . 
	she inquired after his sister , but could do no more . 
	`` it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away , '' said mrs. bennet . 
	he readily agreed to it . 
	`` i began to be afraid you would never come back again . 
	people _ did _ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true . 
	a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . 
	miss lucas is married and settled . 
	and one of my own daughters . 
	i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . 
	it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . 
	it was only said , ` lately , george wickham , esq. to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . 
	it was my brother gardiner 's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . 
	did you see it ? '' 
	bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . 
	elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . 
	how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . 
	`` it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , '' continued her mother , `` but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . 
	they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay i do not know how long . 
	his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the -- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . 
	thank heaven ! 
	he has _ some _ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . '' 
	elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . 
	it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 
	a few weeks , he believed . 
	`` when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley , '' said her mother , `` i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennet 's manor . 
	i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . '' 
	elizabeth 's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! 
	were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 
	at that instant , she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . 
	`` the first wish of my heart , '' said she to herself , `` is never more to be in company with either of them . 
	their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! 
	let me never see either one or the other again ! '' 
	yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover . 
	when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . 
	he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . 
	jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever . 
	but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . 
	when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time . 
	`` you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley , '' she added , `` for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . 
	i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . '' 
	bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . 
	they then went away . 
	mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 
	chapter 54 as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more . 
	mr. darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her . 
	`` why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , '' said she , `` did he come at all ? '' 
	she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . 
	`` he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 
	if he fears me , why come hither ? 
	if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? 
	teasing , teasing , man ! 
	i will think no more about him . '' 
	her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which showed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . 
	`` now , '' said she , `` that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . 
	i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . 
	i am glad he dines here on tuesday . 
	it will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . '' 
	`` yes , very indifferent indeed , '' said elizabeth , laughingly . 
	`` oh , jane , take care . '' 
	`` my dear lizzy , you can not think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? '' 
	`` i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . '' 
	* * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived . 
	on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . 
	when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 
	her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . 
	on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . 
	he placed himself by her . 
	elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 
	he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm . 
	his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane 's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 
	though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . 
	it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . 
	mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them . 
	he was on one side of her mother . 
	she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 
	she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did . 
	her mother 's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth 's mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 
	she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . 
	anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil . 
	she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 
	`` if he does not come to me , _ then _ , '' said she , `` i shall give him up for ever . '' 
	the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 
	the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . 
	and on the gentlemen 's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper : `` the men sha n't come and part us , i am determined . 
	we want none of them ; do we ? '' 
	darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 
	she followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! 
	`` a man who has once been refused ! 
	how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 
	is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? 
	there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! '' 
	she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying : `` is your sister at pemberley still ? '' 
	`` yes , she will remain there till christmas . '' 
	`` and quite alone ? 
	have all her friends left her ? '' 
	`` mrs. annesley is with her . 
	the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks . '' 
	she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 
	he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . 
	when the tea-things were removed , and the card-tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 
	she now lost every expectation of pleasure . 
	they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . 
	mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 
	`` well girls , '' said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , `` what say you to the day ? 
	i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you . 
	the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . 
	the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch . 
	the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases ' last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . 
	and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty . 
	mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . 
	and what do you think she said besides ? 
	` ah ! 
	mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last . ' 
	she did indeed . 
	i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . '' 
	mrs. bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley 's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . 
	`` it has been a very agreeable day , '' said miss bennet to elizabeth . 
	`` the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 
	i hope we may often meet again . '' 
	elizabeth smiled . 
	`` lizzy , you must not do so . 
	you must not suspect me . 
	it mortifies me . 
	i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 
	i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . 
	it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . '' 
	`` you are very cruel , '' said her sister , `` you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . '' 
	`` how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! '' 
	`` and how impossible in others ! '' 
	`` but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? '' 
	`` that is a question which i hardly know how to answer . 
	we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . 
	forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . '' 
	chapter 55 a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone . 
	his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time . 
	he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 
	mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 
	`` next time you call , '' said she , `` i hope we shall be more lucky . '' 
	he should be particularly happy at any time , etc. etc. ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 
	`` can you come to-morrow ? '' 
	yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 
	he came , and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed . 
	in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter 's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out : `` my dear jane , make hast. and hurry down . 
	he is come -- mr. bingley is come . 
	he is , indeed . 
	make hast. , make hast. . 
	here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . 
	never mind miss lizzy 's hair . '' 
	`` we will be down as soon as we can , '' said jane ; `` but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	hang kitty ! 
	what has she to do with it ? 
	come be quick , be quick ! 
	where is your sash , my dear ? '' 
	but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 
	the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening . 
	after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . 
	two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . 
	elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , `` what is the matter mamma ? 
	what do you keep winking at me for ? 
	what am i to do ? '' 
	`` nothing child , nothing . 
	i did not wink at you . '' 
	she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to wast. such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , `` come here , my love , i want to speak to you , '' took her out of the room . 
	jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _ she _ would not give in to it . 
	in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half-opened the door and called out : `` lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . '' 
	elizabeth was forced to go . 
	`` we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; '' said her mother , as soon as she was in the hall . 
	`` kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room . '' 
	elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room . 
	mrs. bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual . 
	bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . 
	his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter . 
	he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet 's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . 
	after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . 
	not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time . 
	seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence . 
	bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 
	the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected . 
	there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him . 
	bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennet 's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter . 
	elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes . 
	but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . 
	on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all . 
	their situation was awkward enough ; but _ hers _ she thought was still worse . 
	not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 
	jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . '' 
	't is too much ! '' 
	she added , `` by far too much . 
	i do not deserve it . 
	oh ! 
	why is not everybody as happy ? '' 
	elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . 
	every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . 
	but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said for the present . 
	`` i must go instantly to my mother ; '' she cried . 
	`` i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . 
	he is gone to my father already . 
	oh ! 
	lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! 
	how shall i bear so much happiness ! '' 
	she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . 
	elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . 
	`` and this , '' said she , `` is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! 
	of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! 
	the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! '' 
	in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 
	`` where is your sister ? '' 
	said he hastily , as he opened the door . 
	`` with my mother up stairs . 
	she will be down in a moment , i dare say . '' 
	he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 
	elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 
	they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of jane 's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and tast. between her and himself . 
	it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet 's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 
	kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . 
	mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was . 
	not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter , and said : `` jane , i congratulate you . 
	you will be a very happy woman . '' 
	jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 
	`` you are a good girl ; '' he replied , `` and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 
	i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . 
	your tempers are by no means unlike . 
	you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . '' 
	`` i hope not so . 
	imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . '' 
	`` exceed their income ! 
	my dear mr. bennet , '' cried his wife , `` what are you talking of ? 
	why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . '' 
	then addressing her daughter , `` oh ! 
	my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! 
	i am sure i sha n't get a wink of sleep all night . 
	i knew how it would be . 
	i always said it must be so , at last . 
	i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! 
	i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . 
	oh ! 
	he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! '' 
	wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . 
	jane was beyond competition her favourite child . 
	at that moment , she cared for no other . 
	her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . 
	mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . 
	bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept . 
	elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 
	in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 
	`` he has made me so happy , '' said she , one evening , `` by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 
	i had not believed it possible . '' 
	`` i suspected as much , '' replied elizabeth . 
	`` but how did he account for it ? '' 
	`` it must have been his sister 's doing . 
	they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 
	but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . '' 
	`` that is the most unforgiving speech , '' said elizabeth , `` that i ever heard you utter . 
	good girl ! 
	it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley 's pretended regard . '' 
	`` would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ! '' 
	`` he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modest. . '' 
	this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . 
	elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 
	`` i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! '' 
	cried jane . 
	`` oh ! 
	lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! 
	if i could but see _ you _ as happy ! 
	if there _ were _ but such another man for you ! '' 
	`` if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you . 
	till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness . 
	no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time . '' 
	the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret . 
	mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. phillips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton . 
	the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 
	chapter 56 one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . 
	it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . 
	the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . 
	as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . 
	they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered . 
	it was lady catherine de bourgh . 
	they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt . 
	she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth 's salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . 
	elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship 's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 
	mrs. bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 
	after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , `` i hope you are well , miss bennet . 
	that lady , i suppose , is your mother . '' 
	elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . 
	`` and _ that _ i suppose is one of your sisters . '' 
	`` yes , madam , '' said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to lady catherine . 
	`` she is my youngest girl but one . 
	my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family . '' 
	`` you have a very small park here , '' returned lady catherine after a short silence . 
	`` it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas 's . '' 
	`` this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . '' 
	mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner , and then added : `` may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well . '' 
	`` yes , very well . 
	i saw them the night before last . '' 
	elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . 
	but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . 
	mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth , `` miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . 
	i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . '' 
	`` go , my dear , '' cried her mother , `` and show her ladyship about the different walks . 
	i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . '' 
	elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs . 
	as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . 
	her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it . 
	they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . 
	`` how could i ever think her like her nephew ? '' 
	said she , as she looked in her face . 
	as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : -- `` you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . 
	your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . '' 
	elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . 
	`` indeed , you are mistaken , madam . 
	i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . '' 
	`` miss bennet , '' replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , `` you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with . 
	but however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . 
	my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . 
	a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . 
	i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy . 
	though i _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . '' 
	`` if you believed it impossible to be true , '' said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , `` i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . 
	what could your ladyship propose by it ? '' 
	`` at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . '' 
	`` your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , '' said elizabeth coolly , `` will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . '' 
	`` if ! 
	do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? 
	has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? 
	do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? '' 
	`` i never heard that it was . '' 
	`` and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? '' 
	`` i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . 
	you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer . '' 
	`` this is not to be borne . 
	miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . 
	has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? '' 
	`` your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . '' 
	`` it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . 
	but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . 
	you may have drawn him in . '' 
	`` if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . '' 
	`` miss bennet , do you know who i am ? 
	i have not been accustomed to such language as this . 
	i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . '' 
	`` but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . '' 
	`` let me be rightly understood . 
	this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . 
	no , never . 
	mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter . 
	now what have you to say ? '' 
	`` only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . '' 
	lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied : `` the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . 
	from their infancy , they have been intended for each other . 
	it was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . 
	while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! 
	do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? 
	to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? 
	are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 
	have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? '' 
	`` yes , and i had heard it before . 
	but what is that to me ? 
	if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh . 
	you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . 
	its completion depended on others . 
	if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 
	and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? '' 
	`` because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . 
	yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . 
	you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . 
	your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . '' 
	`` these are heavy misfortunes , '' replied elizabeth . 
	`` but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . '' 
	`` obstinate , headstrong girl ! 
	i am ashamed of you ! 
	is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? 
	is nothing due to me on that score ? 
	let us sit down . 
	you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it . 
	i have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . 
	i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . '' '' 
	_ that _ will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . '' 
	`` i will not be interrupted . 
	hear me in silence . 
	my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . 
	they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient -- though untitled -- families . 
	their fortune on both sides is splendid . 
	they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? 
	the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . 
	is this to be endured ! 
	but it must not , shall not be . 
	if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . '' 
	`` in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . 
	he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . '' 
	`` true . 
	you _ are _ a gentleman 's daughter . 
	but who was your mother ? 
	who are your uncles and aunts ? 
	do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . '' 
	`` whatever my connections may be , '' said elizabeth , `` if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . '' 
	`` tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? '' 
	though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment 's deliberation : `` i am not . '' 
	lady catherine seemed pleased . 
	`` and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? '' 
	`` i will make no promise of the kind . '' 
	`` miss bennet i am shocked and astonished . 
	i expected to find a more reasonable young woman . 
	but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede . 
	i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require . '' 
	`` and i certainly _ never _ shall give it . 
	i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . 
	your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable ? 
	supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 
	allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged . 
	you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these . 
	how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 
	i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . '' 
	`` not so hast. , if you please . 
	i have by no means done . 
	to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add . 
	i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement . 
	i know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . 
	and is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? 
	is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ? 
	heaven and earth ! 
	-- of what are you thinking ? 
	are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? '' 
	`` you can now have nothing further to say , '' she resentfully answered . 
	`` you have insulted me in every possible method . 
	i must beg to return to the house . '' 
	and she rose as she spoke . 
	lady catherine rose also , and they turned back . 
	her ladyship was highly incensed . 
	`` you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 
	unfeeling , selfish girl ! 
	do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? '' 
	`` lady catherine , i have nothing further to say . 
	you know my sentiments . '' 
	`` you are then resolved to have him ? '' 
	`` i have said no such thing . 
	i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . '' 
	`` it is well . 
	you refuse , then , to oblige me . 
	you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . 
	you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . '' 
	`` neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , '' replied elizabeth , `` have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . 
	no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy . 
	and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . '' 
	`` and this is your real opinion ! 
	this is your final resolve ! 
	very well . 
	i shall now know how to act . 
	do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . 
	i came to try you . 
	i hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , i will carry my point . '' 
	in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , `` i take no leave of you , miss bennet . 
	i send no compliments to your mother . 
	you deserve no such attention . 
	i am most seriously displeased . '' 
	elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 
	she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . 
	her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 
	`` she did not choose it , '' said her daughter , `` she would go . '' 
	`` she is a very fine-looking woman ! 
	and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! 
	for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well . 
	she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you . 
	i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? '' 
	elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 
	chapter 57 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . 
	lady catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy . 
	it was a rational scheme , to be sure ! 
	but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . 
	she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . 
	and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore -lrb- for through their communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine -rrb- , had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time . 
	in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . 
	from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _ he _ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 
	she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . 
	with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . 
	if he had been wavering before as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him . 
	in that case he would return no more . 
	lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . 
	`` if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , '' she added , `` i shall know how to understand it . 
	i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . 
	if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . '' 
	* * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . 
	the next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . 
	`` lizzy , '' said he , `` i was going to look for you ; come into my room . '' 
	she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 
	it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . 
	she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 
	he then said , `` i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . 
	as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 
	i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . 
	let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . '' 
	the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued : `` you look conscious . 
	young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _ your _ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . 
	this letter is from mr. collins . '' 
	`` from mr. collins ! 
	and what can _ he _ have to say ? '' 
	`` something very much to the purpose of course . 
	he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases . 
	i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . 
	what relates to yourself , is as follows : ` having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority . 
	your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ' 
	`` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? '' 
	` this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , -- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . 
	yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ' 
	`` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? 
	but now it comes out : '' ` my motive for cautioning you is as follows . 
	we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ' '' 
	_ mr. darcy _ , you see , is the man ! 
	now , lizzy , i think i _ have _ surprised you . 
	could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? 
	mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! 
	it is admirable ! '' 
	elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 
	never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . 
	`` are you not diverted ? '' 
	`` oh ! 
	yes . 
	pray read on . '' '' 
	` after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . 
	i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ' 
	mr. collins moreover adds , ' i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . 
	i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . 
	it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it . 
	you ought certainly to forgive them , as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ' 
	that is his notion of christian forgiveness ! 
	the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch . 
	but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . 
	you are not going to be _ missish _ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . 
	for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? '' 
	`` oh ! '' 
	cried elizabeth , `` i am excessively diverted . 
	but it is so strange ! '' 
	`` yes -- _ that _ is what makes it amusing . 
	had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! 
	much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration . 
	nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law . 
	and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? 
	did she call to refuse her consent ? '' 
	to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . 
	elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . 
	it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried . 
	her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . 
	chapter 58 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit . 
	the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out . 
	it was agreed to . 
	mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking ; mary could never spare time ; but the remaining five set off together . 
	bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . 
	they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other . 
	very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . 
	they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone . 
	now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said : `` mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding yours . 
	i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . 
	ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it . 
	were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . '' 
	`` i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , '' replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , `` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 
	i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . '' 
	`` you must not blame my aunt . 
	lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars . 
	let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . '' 
	`` if you _ will _ thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone . 
	that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . 
	but your _ family _ owe me nothing . 
	much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of _ you _ . '' 
	elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . 
	after a short pause , her companion added , `` you are too generous to trifle with me . 
	if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . 
	_ my _ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . '' 
	elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . 
	the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . 
	had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 
	they walked on , without knowing in what direction . 
	there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . 
	she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give . 
	but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . 
	`` it taught me to hope , '' said he , `` as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . 
	i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . '' 
	elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , `` yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of _ that _ . 
	after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . '' 
	`` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? 
	for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . 
	it was unpardonable . 
	i can not think of it without abhorrence . '' 
	`` we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , '' said elizabeth . 
	`` the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . '' 
	`` i can not be so easily reconciled to myself . 
	the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . 
	your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ` had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' 
	those were your words . 
	you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; -- though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . '' 
	`` i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . 
	i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . '' 
	`` i can easily believe it . 
	you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did . 
	the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . '' 
	`` oh ! 
	do not repeat what i then said . 
	these recollections will not do at all . 
	i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . '' 
	darcy mentioned his letter . 
	`` did it , '' said he , `` did it soon make you think better of me ? 
	did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? '' 
	she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . 
	`` i knew , '' said he , `` that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . 
	i hope you have destroyed the letter . 
	there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again . 
	i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . '' 
	`` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . '' 
	`` when i wrote that letter , '' replied darcy , `` i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . '' 
	`` the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . 
	the adieu is charity itself . 
	but think no more of the letter . 
	the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . 
	you must learn some of my philosophy . 
	think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . '' 
	`` i can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . 
	your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence . 
	but with me , it is not so . 
	painful recollections will intrude which can not , which ought not , to be repelled . 
	i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . 
	as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper . 
	i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 
	unfortunately an only son -lrb- for many years an only child -rrb- , i was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves -lrb- my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable -rrb- , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . 
	such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! 
	what do i not owe you ! 
	you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . 
	by you , i was properly humbled . 
	i came to you without a doubt of my reception . 
	you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . '' 
	`` had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? '' 
	`` indeed i had . 
	what will you think of my vanity ? 
	i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . '' 
	`` my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you . 
	i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 
	how you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ? '' 
	`` hate you ! 
	i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . '' 
	`` i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at pemberley . 
	you blamed me for coming ? '' 
	`` no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise . '' 
	`` your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . 
	my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . '' 
	`` my object then , '' replied darcy , `` was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 
	how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . '' 
	he then told her of georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 
	she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther . 
	after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home . 
	`` what could become of mr. bingley and jane ! '' 
	was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . 
	darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . 
	`` i must ask whether you were surprised ? '' 
	said elizabeth . 
	`` not at all . 
	when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . '' 
	`` that is to say , you had given your permission . 
	i guessed as much . '' 
	and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . 
	`` on the evening before my going to london , '' said he , `` i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago . 
	i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . 
	his surprise was great . 
	he had never had the slightest suspicion . 
	i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . '' 
	elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 
	`` did you speak from your own observation , '' said she , `` when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? '' 
	`` from the former . 
	i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here ; and i was convinced of her affection . '' 
	`` and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . '' 
	`` it did . 
	bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 
	his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy . 
	i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 
	i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . 
	he was angry . 
	but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . 
	he has heartily forgiven me now . '' 
	elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . 
	she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . 
	in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . 
	in the hall they parted . 
	chapter 59 `` my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? '' 
	was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . 
	she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge . 
	she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . 
	the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary . 
	the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent . 
	darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 
	she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 
	at night she opened her heart to jane . 
	though suspicion was very far from miss bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 
	`` you are joking , lizzy . 
	this can not be ! 
	-- engaged to mr. darcy ! 
	no , no , you shall not deceive me . 
	i know it to be impossible . '' 
	`` this is a wretched beginning indeed ! 
	my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 
	yet , indeed , i am in earnest . 
	i speak nothing but the truth . 
	he still loves me , and we are engaged . '' 
	jane looked at her doubtingly . 
	`` oh , lizzy ! 
	it can not be . 
	i know how much you dislike him . '' 
	`` you know nothing of the matter . 
	_ that _ is all to be forgot . 
	perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now . 
	but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . 
	this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . '' 
	miss bennet still looked all amazement . 
	elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth . 
	`` good heaven ! 
	can it be really so ! 
	yet now i must believe you , '' cried jane . 
	`` my dear , dear lizzy , i would -- i do congratulate you -- but are you certain ? 
	forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? '' 
	`` there can be no doubt of that . 
	it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . 
	but are you pleased , jane ? 
	shall you like to have such a brother ? '' 
	`` very , very much . 
	nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight . 
	but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . 
	and do you really love him quite well enough ? 
	oh , lizzy ! 
	do anything rather than marry without affection . 
	are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? '' 
	`` oh , yes ! 
	you will only think i feel _ more _ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . '' 
	`` what do you mean ? '' 
	`` why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley . 
	i am afraid you will be angry . '' 
	`` my dearest sister , now _ be _ serious . 
	i want to talk very seriously . 
	let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay . 
	will you tell me how long you have loved him ? '' 
	`` it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began . 
	but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . '' 
	another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 
	when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish . 
	`` now i am quite happy , '' said she , `` for you will be as happy as myself . 
	i always had a value for him . 
	were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . 
	but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 
	how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! 
	i owe all that i know of it to another , not to you . '' 
	elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . 
	she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend . 
	but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia 's marriage . 
	all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation . 
	* * * * * `` good gracious ! '' 
	cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , `` if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! 
	what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? 
	i had no notion but he would go a-shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . 
	what shall we do with him ? 
	lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . '' 
	elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . 
	as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mrs. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? '' 
	`` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning . 
	it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . '' 
	`` it may do very well for the others , '' replied mr. bingley ; `` but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . 
	wo n't it , kitty ? '' 
	kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . 
	darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . 
	as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying : `` i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . 
	but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 
	so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . '' 
	during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening . 
	elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's . 
	she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . 
	but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . 
	* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 
	she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her means -- that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 
	in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . '' 
	she was gone directly . 
	her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . 
	`` lizzy , '' said he , `` what are you doing ? 
	are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? 
	have not you always hated him ? '' 
	how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! 
	it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy . 
	`` or , in other words , you are determined to have him . 
	he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . 
	but will they make you happy ? '' 
	`` have you any other objection , '' said elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? '' 
	`` none at all . 
	we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . '' 
	`` i do , i do like him , '' she replied , with tears in her eyes , `` i love him . 
	indeed he has no improper pride . 
	he is perfectly amiable . 
	you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . '' 
	`` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent . 
	he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . 
	i now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . 
	but let me advise you to think better of it . 
	i know your disposition , lizzy . 
	i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . 
	your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 
	you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . 
	my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . 
	you know not what you are about . '' 
	elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ' suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . 
	`` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say . 
	if this be the case , he deserves you . 
	i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to anyone less worthy . '' 
	to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . 
	he heard her with astonishment . 
	`` this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! 
	and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! 
	so much the better . 
	it will save me a world of trouble and economy . 
	had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . 
	i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . '' 
	he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , `` if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . '' 
	elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 
	every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . 
	when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . 
	its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . 
	nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . 
	she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 
	`` good gracious ! 
	lord bless me ! 
	only think ! 
	dear me ! 
	mr. darcy ! 
	who would have thought it ! 
	and is it really true ? 
	oh ! 
	my sweetest lizzy ! 
	how rich and how great you will be ! 
	what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! 
	jane 's is nothing to it -- nothing at all . 
	i am so pleased -- so happy . 
	such a charming man ! 
	-- so handsome ! 
	so tall ! 
	-- oh , my dear lizzy ! 
	pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . 
	i hope he will overlook it . 
	dear , dear lizzy . 
	a house in town ! 
	every thing that is charming ! 
	three daughters married ! 
	ten thousand a year ! 
	oh , lord ! 
	what will become of me . 
	i shall go distracted . '' 
	this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . 
	but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 
	`` my dearest child , '' she cried , `` i can think of nothing else ! 
	ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 
	't is as good as a lord ! 
	and a special licence . 
	you must and shall be married by a special licence . 
	but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . '' 
	this was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for . 
	but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . 
	elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 
	`` i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , '' said he . 
	`` wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as jane 's . '' 
	chapter 60 elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . 
	`` how could you begin ? '' 
	said she . 
	`` i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? '' 
	`` i can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . 
	it is too long ago . 
	i was in the middle before i knew that i _ had _ begun . '' 
	`` my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . 
	now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? '' 
	`` for the liveliness of your mind , i did . '' 
	`` you may as well call it impertinence at once . 
	it was very little less . 
	the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 
	you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . 
	i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike _ them _ . 
	had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . 
	there -- i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable . 
	to be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . '' 
	`` was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield ? '' 
	`` dearest jane ! 
	who could have done less for her ? 
	but make a virtue of it by all means . 
	my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 
	what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? 
	why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? '' 
	`` because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . '' 
	`` but i was embarrassed . '' 
	`` and so was i. '' `` you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . '' 
	`` a man who had felt less , might . '' 
	`` how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 
	but i wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 
	i wonder when you _ would _ have spoken , if i had not asked you ! 
	my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . 
	_ too much _ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? 
	for i ought not to have mentioned the subject . 
	this will never do . '' 
	`` you need not distress yourself . 
	the moral will be perfectly fair . 
	lady catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . 
	i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 
	i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours . 
	my aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing . '' 
	`` lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . 
	but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? 
	was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? 
	or had you intended any more serious consequence ? '' 
	`` my real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me . 
	my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . '' 
	`` shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her ? '' 
	`` i am more likely to want more time than courage , elizabeth . 
	but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . '' 
	`` and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 
	but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . '' 
	from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner 's long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : `` i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write . 
	you supposed more than really existed . 
	but _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . 
	you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 
	i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes . 
	how could i be so silly as to wish it ! 
	your idea of the ponies is delightful . 
	we will go round the park every day . 
	i am the happiest creature in the world . 
	perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . 
	i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh . 
	mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me . 
	you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . 
	yours , etc. '' mr. darcy 's letter to lady catherine was in a different style ; and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last . 
	`` dear sir , `` i must trouble you once more for congratulations . 
	elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy . 
	console lady catherine as well as you can . 
	but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . 
	he has more to give . 
	`` yours sincerely , etc. '' miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . 
	she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . 
	jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 
	the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother 's in sending it . 
	four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . 
	before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . 
	the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . 
	lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . 
	at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . 
	he bore it , however , with admirable calmness . 
	he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. james 's , with very decent composure . 
	if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight . 
	mrs. phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . 
	nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . 
	elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . 
	chapter 61 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . 
	with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed . 
	i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly . 
	mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . 
	he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . 
	mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . 
	so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart . 
	the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . 
	kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . 
	in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . 
	she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . 
	from the further disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . 
	mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone . 
	mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance . 
	as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . 
	he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 
	the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 
	the letter was to this effect : `` my dear lizzy , `` i wish you joy . 
	if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy . 
	it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us . 
	i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 
	any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not . 
	`` yours , etc. '' as it happened that elizabeth had _ much _ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . 
	such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them . 
	it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . 
	their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . 
	they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . 
	his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 
	though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him further in his profession . 
	lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 
	miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . 
	pemberley was now georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . 
	they were able to love each other even as well as they intended . 
	georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother . 
	he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 
	her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . 
	by elizabeth 's instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 
	lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 
	but at length , by elizabeth 's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . 
	with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . 
	darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
